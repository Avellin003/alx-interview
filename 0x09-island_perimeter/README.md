# Island Perimeter

This Python project calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid. The grid consists of cells representing land (1) and water (0). The goal is to find the perimeter of the island, considering the following rules:

- Each cell is square, with a side length of 1.
- Cells are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
- The grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100.
- The grid is completely surrounded by water.
- There is only one island (or nothing).
- The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water surrounding the island).

## Usage

To use the `island_perimeter` function, follow these steps:

1. Import the function:
   ```python
   from island_perimeter import island_perimeter
   ```

2. Create a grid (list of lists) representing the island. For example:
   ```python
   grid = [
       [0, 1, 0, 0],
       [1, 1, 1, 0],
       [0, 1, 0, 0],
       [1, 1, 0, 0]
   ]
   ```

3. Call the function with the grid as an argument:
   ```python
   perimeter = island_perimeter(grid)
   print(f"The perimeter of the island is: {perimeter}")
   ```

## Example

For the given grid:
```
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
```

The perimeter of the island is 16.

## Implementation

The `island_perimeter` function iterates through the grid, counting the perimeter based on adjacent land cells. It handles edge cases and ensures that the island is completely surrounded by water.
